# How-to guides

These guides accompany through the various stages of building and publishing
kernel packages and components.

## Source code access and management

You can get access to kernel source code via `apt` or directly from the kernel Git repositories.
You can also check the formatting requirements, review process, and best practices for submitting kernel patches to the Ubuntu kernel team mailing list.

## Development and customization

The steps to build a kernel is similar but may have slightly difference configuration requirements on depending on the build package (snap, debs), platform and/or architectures.

- {doc}`Build an Ubuntu Linux kernel snap </how-to/develop-customise/build-kernel-snap>`
- {doc}`Rebuild a single kernel module </how-to/develop-customise/build-kernel-module>`

## Testing and verification

These guides relate to testing the kernel to ensure its stability and
functionality before you push or release a patch.
